 <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
 <p>Welcome to nolimitcarter’s blog. It is a markdown based blog that I try to keep looking that way (github markdown style). I’m new to blogging so I thought setting this pandoc site up and keeping it simpilistic was a good idea. I never really considered myself a blogger but I’m sure you know how it goes, once you get told enough to make a blog, you end up doing it. There is a good chance I wil just be posting once a week or every other week. The following content is mostly for myself, people who have the same interests as me, and to stay up to date with some of the projects I am taking on. Be prepared for a lot of ranting, notes, tasks/challenges, hacking, and random bullshit.</p>
 <h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
 <p>I started programming towards the end of my junior year in high-school and since then have been pretty much obsessed with all aspects of tech. We live in this time era where we can do just about anything with the touch of our figers. I am constantly taking notes, going through things, making new things, trying different platforms, distros, software, etc. and I feel that it is best to capture some of this stuff in a more formal style compared to your typical notes repo. I hope that someone reading this will learn something. I also feel like it is important to include that I am currently in the progress of getting my Bachelor’s of Science in cybersecurity and while I am trying not to make this pertain to schoolwork, a lot of the topics in this will likely be cybersecurity and programming based.</p>
 <p>With all of that being said, I am not too sure what this blog will hold, so continue reading at your own risk:</p>
 <h2 id="index">Index</h2>
 <p>Some of the entries might have keywords at the top, that is to make things easier for myself and others wanting to search for specific topics.</p>
